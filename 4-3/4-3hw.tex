    \item This figure shows the net of a three-dimensional shape called a truncated octahedron.
        How many vertices does a truncated octahedron have?

    \item What is the greatest distance between any two vertices of a rectangular prism with dimensions $\SI{8}{cm}$ by $\SI{9}{cm}$ by $\SI{12}{cm}$?

    \item What is the total surface area of a right square pyramid with a height of $12$ feet and a base with side length of $10$ feet?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item A right circular cone with base radius $\SI{4}{cm}$ has surface area $\SI{56\pi}{cm^2}$.
        What is the height of the cone?
        Express your answer in simplest radical form.

    \item A cylindrical container holds $20$ fluid ounces.
        It has a radius of $3$ inches and a height of $12$ inches.
        How many fluid ounces will a similar container with a radius of $4.5$ inches hold?
        Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.
