\subsection*{Fractions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Given $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{y}{z} = \frac{3}{2}$, find $\frac{x}{z}$.
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item Find $\frac{x}{y}$ if $\frac{x + 2y}{x - y} = \frac{3}{4}$.
            \vspace{3cm}
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Percents}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
        \item In a school election, candidate $A$ got $33.\bar{3}\%$ of the votes cast, $B$ got $\frac{9}{20}$ of the votes, $C$ got $\frac{2}{15}$ of the votes, and candidate D got the remaining $75$ votes.
            How many students voted in the election?
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item The price of a car is originally $\$\num{10000}$.
            If the price is decreased by $25\%$, then increased by $25\%$.
            What is the resulting price?
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item Ms.\ A owns a house worth $\$\num{10000}$.
            She sells it to Mr.\ B at $10\%$ profit.
            Mr.\ B sells the house back to Ms.\ A at a $10\%$ loss.
            How much money does Ms.\ A make?
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item Before a plum is dried to become a prune, it is $92\%$ water.
            A prune is just $20\%$ water.
            If only water is evaporated in the drying process, how many pounds of prunes can be made with $100$ pounds of plums?
            \vspace{3cm}
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Ratios}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
        \item There are red, white, and blue marbles in a bag in the ratio $2 : 3 : 4$.
            If the bag contains $108$ marbles, how many of them are blue?
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item If the ratio of $2x - y \Rightarrow x + y$ is $2 : 3$, find the ratio $x : y$.
            \vspace{3cm}
    \end{enumerate}
