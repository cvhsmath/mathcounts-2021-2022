    $30$ yards wide.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If he places a fence post at each corner and posts are placed 
            every three yards, how many fence posts will there be on each 
            side?

    \item Every student who applied for admission to a veterinary school has 
    at least one pet: $30$ have a cat, $28$ have a dog, and $26$ have 
    fish. If $13$ students have a fish and cat, $15$ students have 
    fish and dog, $11$ students have a cat and dog, and $4$ 
    students have all three, how many students applied to 
    veterinary school?
