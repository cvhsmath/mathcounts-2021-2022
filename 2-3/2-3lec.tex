\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many four letter ``words'' are there if we ignore spelling?
		\vspace{3cm}
	\item How many four-letter ``words'' are there with vowels (not including Y) 
		in the middle two places and a consonant at the end?
		\vspace{3cm}
	\item How many four letter ``words'' are there with vowels in the middle two 
		places and consonants in the other two, with no letter repeated?
		\vspace{3cm}
    \item In how many ways can a five letter ``word'' be written using only the 
        first half of the alphabet with no repetitions such that the third and 
        fifth letters are vowels and the first letter is a consonant?
		\vspace{3cm}
    \item In how many ways can the letters in the word MINIMIZATION be arranged 
        such that no two vowels are consecutive?
		\vspace{3cm}
    \item How many five-digit numbers ending with $1$, $2$, or $4$ are there 
        with no digit repeated?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many odd numbers with third digit $5$ are there between $20000$ 
		and $69999$ inclusive?
		\vspace{3cm}
    \item Numbers that read the same forward and backward are called 
        palindromes. How many three-digit numbers are palindromes?
