\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many positive integers in the set of numbers from $1$ to $1000$ inclusive are multiples of $2$, $3$ and $5$ but not $8$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item What fraction of positive integer factors of $1000^3$ are perfect squares?
        Express your answer as a common fraction.

    \item Maxine secretly chooses a positive integer between $1$ and $2018$, inclusive.
        Martin wants to identify her number with a series of guesses.
        Each time Martin makes a guess, Maxine tells him whether his number is correct, too high, or too low.
        With an appropriate strategy, Martin can always identify Maxine's number after at most $n$ guesses.
        What is the least value of $n$ for which Martin can correctly guess Maxine's number?

    \item Chase Coutinho has $p$ pennies, $n$ nickels, $d$ dimes and $q$ quarters with a total value of $\$1.08$.
        If the numbers $p$, $n$, $d$ and $q$ are distinct and positive, and the greatest common divisor of each pair of these numbers is $1$, what is the least possible value of $p + n + d + q$?
