\item The table below displays some of the results of last summer's Frostbite Falls Fishing Festival, showing how many contestants caught $n$ fish for varius values of $n$.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            $n$ & $0$ & $1$ & $2$ & $3$ & $\dots$ & $13$ & $14$ & $15$ \\
            \hline
            number of contestants who caught $n$ fish & $9$ & $5$ & $7$ & $23$ & $\dots$ & $5$ & $2$ & $1$ \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    In the newspaper story covering the event, it was reported that:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item the winner caught 15 fish;
        \item those who caught 3 or more fish averaged 6 fish each;
        \item those who caught 12 or fewer fish averaged 5 fish each.
    \end{enumerate}
    What was the total number of fish caught during the festival?
\end{enumerate}
