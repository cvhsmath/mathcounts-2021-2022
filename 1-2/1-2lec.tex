    \item The sum of two numbers is $5$ and their product is $2$.
        What is the sum of the squares of the two numbers?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item The sum of two numbers is $7$ and their product is $12$.
        What is twice the sum of their reciprocals?
        Express your answer as a common fraction.

    \item A square has an area of $\SI{50}{cm^2}$.
        The length is increased by $\SI{4}{cm}$ and the width is decreased by $\SI{4}{cm}$.
        What is the area of the resulting rectangle?

    \item What is the sum of two consecutive positive integers whose squares differ by $45$?

    \item Given that $9876^2 = 97535376$, find $9877^2$ without using multiplication.

    \item If $a + b = 1$ and $a^2 + b^2 = 2$, find $a^4 + b^4$.
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many different real numbers $x$ satisfy the equation $\left(x^2 - 5\right)^2 = 16$?
